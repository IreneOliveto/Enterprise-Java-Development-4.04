Did you use the same type of route to update patient information and to update an employee department?
No, I'used Patch to update a doctor’s department and Put to update patient’s information.


Why did you choose the strategy that you chose?
Because to update a doctor's department I don't need to access to all his information and modifying them, instead to change a patient information I have to access all his information.


What are the pros and cons of the strategies you chose for creating these routes?
The pros to use a Patch to modify a part of the entity's information is that it is more efficient.


What are the tradeoffs between PUT and PATCH?
With Put you can modify ALL the entity and it is not as much efficient as the patch, intead with the Patch you can modify just a part of the entity.
